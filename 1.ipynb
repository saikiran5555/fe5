    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, and to interpret the result, you need the specific data values for these two variables. However, without the actual data, I can guide you through the general steps to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and how to interpret it. If you have the data, you can apply these steps:\n",
