    "To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the number of hours individuals spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity, you'll need the specific data points from the sample of 50 participants. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables. It ranges from -1 to +1, where +1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 indicates no linear relationship.\n",
