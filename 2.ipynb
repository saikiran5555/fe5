    "To calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level, you first need to have the data for these two variables. Spearman's rank correlation is a non-parametric measure that assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function. It's particularly useful when your data do not meet the assumptions of Pearson's correlation (such as not being normally distributed or having outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation involves ranking each set of data and then applying the Pearson correlation formula to these ranks. If you have your data ready, you can use Python to calculate the Spearman's rank correlation. Here's an example of how you would do it:"

    "A Spearman's rank correlation (corr) close to 1 implies a strong positive monotonic relationship, while a correlation close to -1 implies a strong negative monotonic relationship. A value near 0 suggests little to no monotonic relationship.\n",
